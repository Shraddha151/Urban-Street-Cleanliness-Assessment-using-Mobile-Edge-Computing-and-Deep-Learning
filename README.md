# Urban-Street-Cleanliness-Assessment-using-Mobile-Edge-Computing-and-Deep-Learning
During the process of smart city construction, city managers always spend a lot of energy and money for cleaning street garbage due to the random appearances of street garbage. Consequently, visual street cleanliness assessment is particularly important. However, the existing assessment approaches have some clear disadvantages, such as the collection of street garbage information is not automated and street cleanliness information is not real-time. To address these disadvantages, this paper proposes a novel urban street cleanliness assessment approach using mobile edge computing and deep learning. First, the high-resolution cameras installed on vehicles collect the street images. Mobile edge servers are used to store and extract street image information temporarily. Second, these processed street data is transmitted to the cloud data center for analysis through city networks. At the same time, Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is used to identify the street garbage categories and count the number of garbage. Finally, the results are incorporated into the street cleanliness calculation framework to ultimately visualize the street cleanliness levels, which provides convenience for city managers to arrange clean-up personnel effectively.
